please create a form that accept the information mentioned above, these information should be store in firebase/firestore
in a collection named "idps", also each idp has an id and that id should be in the following format:
YYMMDD{RANDOM_ID}
the random id should be generated using nanoid library
please keep the design simple, I've already installed chakra, group related information together

we have already installed react hook form library to manage the state of the forms
